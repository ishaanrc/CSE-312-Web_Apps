## How to use
Use https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/ to run app if you are not familiar with flask.
* navigate to CSE-312-Web_Apps/flaskr
* Docker compose not yet fully functional but you can run it to create a docker container with a db running, and then run the application as directed below
* run wsgi.py with python3, navigate to port 8000, not 5000
* To be clear in its current state the docker compose will only create a container for the database, and the application must be run as normal
